hey, i'm siddharth
cs @ cal poly slo · building things that probably should already exist
currently:

making ai agents easier to debug → orbis
wrote a search engine in rust because i wanted to understand how they actually work
building infra @ codebox, shipping features @ hack4impact

recent stuff i'm proud of:

researchq — rag app for synthesizing research papers
patent discovery — turned 20+ hours of legal research into a few minutes

i like: rust, systems programming, figuring out how things work under the hood
